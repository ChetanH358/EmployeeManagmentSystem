    w.k.t we have classbased and funtion based component
    * In class component we can define state but where as function components are stateless component
    * In order to use state in funtional component we can use hook

    Hooks ->
    * useState -> is hook(function) that allows you to have state varibales in funtional components

    * useEffect -> allows us to perform side effect(an action) in funtion components means component render and reRendering 
        Effect Hooks are equivalent to componentDidMount() , componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() lifecycle methods
        in classbased components we use componentDidMount in the same way useEffect is used in funciton components to make ajax or API call

    * useHistory -> gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate
        After submitting the form user may able to navigate to the list-employee page for that we need navigation
        Once we get history object we able to navigate

    * useParams -> we need to retrive id from url . this hook provides object that contains key value pair from the url
